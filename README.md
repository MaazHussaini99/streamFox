### Home Screens
This was our first design of the home screen where we were experimenting with the button layout.

This is our final design of the home screen where we chose to use this button layout instead with the logo, profile placement, dropdown menu placement.

### Step 1
This was our initial design for Step 1 of the Step-By-Step process for navigating through how to collect information after an accident.

This was our updated final design for Step 1 of the Step-By-Step process.

### Step 2
Once we finalized our design for Step 1, we followed that design template for the subsequent steps of the Step-By-Step process.

### Step 3

#### Information Exchange
Initially, we had the information exchange form be all in one location as a single form, but we wanted it to look less cluttered and have a cleaner look. We split the form into multiple parts (including vehicle information and insurance information), so information is grouped and easier to edit and access. This keeps the information we are having the user look at to a minimum.

### Step 4
This stage follows the same pattern as the other previous activities for the Step-By-Step process. We decided to enable users to manually enter location information, as well as have options to access both the Camera and GPS.

#### Camera Access
Our initial design for the camera access is based on the feature provided in the messages app on Android phones. The user should be able to have the option to select a photo from their gallery, or take a new photo. The second camera image is if the user decides to take a photo, it makes the image larger, so that they can see more clearly.

### Step 5
This was our initial design for the final step of the Step-By-Step process. We wanted to include a checklist so users can verify that they completed and collected all pertinent information relating to the accident.
